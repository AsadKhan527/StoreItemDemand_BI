# 📊 Power BI Dashboard: Store Item Demand Forecasting

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and evaluate store item-level demand forecasting using multiple time series models. The dashboard provides key business insights into sales trends, prediction accuracy, and model performance.

## 🔍 Overview

The dashboard analyzes a large-scale sales dataset using statistical and deep learning-based forecasting models including:
- ARIMA
- SARIMA
- Exponential Smoothing
- LSTM

Each model is compared using key metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to help identify the most accurate forecasting method.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Visualizations** of cumulative price index and predicted sales trends  
- **Comparison of models** using evaluation metrics  
- **Summary KPI cards** (Total Sales, Items, Stores, Forecasted Demand, Sales per Day)  
- **Identification of Best Model**  
- **Clean, professional layout** for business storytelling  

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Power BI** – Dashboard design and data modeling  
- **Python** – Time series modeling and data preprocessing  
- **Streamlit** – Web app deployment for forecasting models  
- **Plotly & Statsmodels** – For forecasting and model evaluation  

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this dashboard comes from the [Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/demand-forecasting/data), containing historical sales data at a daily level for multiple store-item combinations.
